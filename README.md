# nasa-apod-backend

Get the frontend source code [here](https://www.github.com/jakefrancis/nasa-apod)

Backend for my infinite scrolling Astronomy Picture of the Day React App.

Serves as a proxy server to protect the identity of a Nasa API key.

If a request has never been made before then, a GET request is sent to the NASA APOD API, the response data is then cached into a MONGODB.
